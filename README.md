# sophisticatedEnglish
app project for udacity course
The app is about to learn synonyms in English. I realized that my English vocabulary is quite rich, however I do not know many synonyms especially for adjectives. So I decided to create an app to practice and learn in a playful way. My app has basically 2 main parts: a Synonym vocabulary, where you can see words and their synonyms and a quiz, where you can practice.
